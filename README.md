The Algorithm Simulator is an interactive educational tool designed to help users understand the concepts of various data structures and sorting algorithms through hands-on experience. This Java-based application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to visualize the inner workings of popular algorithms and data structures.

The project begins with a user-friendly homepage featuring three main buttons: "Sorting," "Searching," and "Insertion/Deletion." Users can choose the desired category by clicking on the respective button.

In the "Sorting" section, the simulator demonstrates various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. Users can input custom arrays, and the simulator showcases step-by-step executions of the sorting algorithms, illustrating how elements are compared, swapped, and sorted.

In the "Searching" section, users can explore fundamental searching algorithms, such as Linear Search and Binary Search. The simulator visually guides users through each search step, highlighting the comparison process and locating the target element.

The "Insertion/Deletion" section focuses on basic operations of inserting and deleting elements in an array. Users can enter their custom array and observe the step-by-step execution of these operations.

The project incorporates a visually appealing GUI with dynamic resizing and informative pop-up messages to enhance the user experience. Additionally, error handling ensures that users receive prompt feedback on any invalid input.

The Algorithm Simulator is an excellent resource for students, educators, and programming enthusiasts seeking an interactive and engaging way to grasp core concepts of data structures and sorting algorithms. Through its user-friendly interface and detailed visualizations, the simulator fosters a deeper understanding of the fundamental algorithms used in computer science and programming. Whether used as a study tool or for exploration, the Algorithm Simulator empowers learners to build a strong foundation in data structures and sorting algorithms, facilitating their journey into the world of computer science.
